# My Collaborative experiences in Esport world

Hello, I'm Risqi

This is an English assignment assigned to me by my university lecturer. 

The content must have the following:
- What was the name of the project?
- When and where did it happen?
- With whom did you collaborate?
- How was the beginning of your collaboration?
- What was the problem during your collaboration?
- How did you solve the problem?
- What is the conclusion of the story?


It necessitates the creation of a blog post for publishing whatever I choose to write. Thus, I have decided to craft it here on my personal website. The task centers around a collaborative experience, and I must admit, my experiences have been anything but ordinary.

I intend to share a unique aspect of my life within the gaming community, a realm where collaboration is of utmost importance. My journey in the world of gaming commenced when I was a mere 12 years old, a time when my parents bestowed upon me my first computer. This computer, although powered by an aging Pentium processor, was, in its own way, a special model for that era. It introduced me to the world of gaming, albeit not with the smoothness that modern machines afford. It's amusing to consider that the model, which I held dear back then, is now regarded as an antiquated relic.

Throughout my gaming journey, I explored a myriad of game genres, trying my hand at virtually every type available. However, I found myself most captivated by first-person shooter (FPS) games. The list of FPS titles I've delved into is extensive, including well-known names like Battlefield, Call of Duty, FarCry, Crysis, and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, along with newer additions like Valorant and various iterations of Counter-Strike. FPS games, more than any other genre, demand collaboration and teamwork to secure victories, especially in the competitive arena.

In the realm of eSports and competitive gaming, teamwork and collaboration are essential. To compete in championships and tournaments successfully, I teamed up with highly skilled and collaborative players. I've participated in online competitive tournaments as well as LAN (local area network) tournaments held in game centers in my city.

Believe it or not, teamwork is the cornerstone of success in these gaming tournaments. The path to team building and championship victories was not without its initial challenges, as we had to adapt to the unique skills and roles of each player on our team. Over time, however, it became progressively easier, and our collaborative skills sharpened.

the picture above is not my team. it's other team.

While teamwork became our strength, it did not come without its share of difficulties. Diverse viewpoints and strategies, and sometimes language barriers, posed challenges. However, we tackled these obstacles through experience, mutual understanding, patience, practice, and above all, enjoyment.

In conclusion, the essence of this narrative is that collaboration within a team is a key factor for improvement. Competitive gaming tournaments rival the complexity of math or science competitions. To succeed, we need to incorporate strategies, teamwork, talent, and, most importantly, a sense of fun. This dynamic combination is what ultimately ensures a smooth and rewarding gaming experience.
